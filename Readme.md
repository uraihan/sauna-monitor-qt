# Sauna Temperature Monitor

A simple sauna temperature monitor, created in Qt/QML.

Inside the demo app, there is a function to demonstrate accessing Raspberry Pi GPIO through Qt using libgpiod library. The idea is, during the HEATING state, an LED is set to active. To see this in action, you need:

- A breadboard
- An LED
- 220 Ohm Resistor
- A few jumper cables (at least 2 male-to-female jumper cables to connect Raspberry Pi to the external board)
